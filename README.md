# tax-calculator

This project contains my solution for the technical assessment. 
To consider :
  - For test data feeding input , the chosen option is hard coded data within unit test (as it is suggested in the assessment formulation).
  - Main tests for the application are included into AppTest.java class. The rest test classes are about unit tests.
  - Software stack includes : 
    - java 8 
    - maven 3.6
    - junit 4
    - lombok java library
    - junitparams java library.
  - Project is using GitHub workflows as CI tool. List of project builds is available by clicking on "Actions" tab.
